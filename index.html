      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p> The object of this game is to reach the 'Black Exit Door' </p>
      <p> As soon as any robot touches the 'Black Exit Door', the score increases.</p>
      <p> The arrows can change the moving direction of the Robots.</p>
      <p> The direction of an arrow can be changed by clicking on it.</p>
      <p> The arrows with the white borders are 'Locked' and cannot change their direction.</p>
      <p> Each movable arrow can change direction only 5 times, after that it gets locked.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Overview of Design Process</h2>
      <p style = "padding-left: 20px;padding-right: 20px;"> The game is designed and developed using Javascript's powerful p5js Library. It was created under the 4th Assignment of the class Interactive Computing at NYU College of Arts & Science. This game, Robot Factory, makes use of Object Oriented Programming where individual classes are defined for the Robots and the Arrows. The Robots are responsible for checking whether they are near any of the Arrows and if so, they change their direction with the direction of the arrow. Similarly, the built in functionality of p5js is used to detect if the mouse is clicked, and if so, the Arrows check the distance of the mouse click from their centre and accordingly change their direction in a sequential order. </p>
